# READMEfileGenerator

## Descriptoin

A command line JavaScript project that takes user input using inquirer, then creates a professional README file. It uses node js and the inquirer package to run. This allows users to make README files more quickly.

 ## Installation

Make sure to have node js installed. I used the recommended version which is 20.10.0 LTS as of now. After installed, in the terminal type "npm install -y" and hit enter. This should install the inquirer package. Afterwards type "node index.js" to run the code.

Link to node js: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Usage

Follow how I did it in the video, to see the user input and commands used in terminal. Once input has been entered and code has completed. A 'README.ms' file should appear in the directory "fileCreated." NOTICE: This will overwrite the current README file in that folder.
